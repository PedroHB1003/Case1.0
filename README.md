I also did some diagrams (with <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">LucidChart!</a>), one for my planning, can be accessed [Here!](https://github.com/PedroHB1003/Case1.0/blob/master/Case1.0_Diagrama.pdf), and another for my understanding in the OAuth 2.0 technology, [Here!](https://github.com/PedroHB1003/Case1.0/blob/master/Case1.0_Diagrama_OAuth2.0.pdf)
